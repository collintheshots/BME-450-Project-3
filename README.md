# BME 450 Project 3 SeisMap
Collin Tasaka

Winter 2020

I got my data by going to the USGS Earthquake Catalog and selecting earthquakes magnitude 2.5 and above from 2010 to today within a certain boundary. The boundary I chose was the same as the one that you approved for the class from Matthew, (-131.821, -122.1706, 38.8915, 52.013). This creates a bounding box around the plate of Juan de Fuca. I had originally chosen the larger area described in your project description, but it was ultimately too much data and it took 10 minutes to produce each of my graphs.
